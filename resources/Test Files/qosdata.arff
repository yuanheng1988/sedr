% 4. Past Usage: This data was used for:
%
%    Jia Zhou, Kendra Cooper, and I-Ling Yen, "QoS Data Collection: An Approach 
%    to Assist Predictable QoS Behavior Modeling in Component Based Development", 
%    PROMISE - Predictive Models in Software Engineering Workshop, ICSE 2006, 
%    September 24, 2006, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA.
%
% We used a QoS data collection approach to measure the QoS data for a library 
% of numerical computation components. Each component in the library is executed
% on three platforms (windows, unix, linux). QoS data for time (reponse time), 
% space (memory usage), and quality (output precision or accuracy) are measured.
% This QoS data allows us to predict the QoS behaviors of a component in the library. 
% The capability of predicting the QoS behaviors can greatly assist the development 
% of a component-based application system to satisfy the QoS requirements.
%
% 5. Number of Instances: 272 
%
% 6. Number of Attributes: 6 
%
% 7. Attribute Information:
%
% componentname:  The name of the component. It is the name of the component file 
% without the ".c" extension name.
%
% time_u: The average response time of a component measured on the Unix platform. 
% The Unix platform runs SunOS 5.9. It equips a 500MHz UltraSPARC IIi processor, 
% 128MB of memory, and 7200RPM of hard drive. The unit is in milliseconds. 
%
% time_w: The average response time of a component measured on the Windows platform. 
% The Windows platform runs Windows XP. It equips a 2.8GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU, 
% 1GB of memory, and 7200RPM of hard drive. The unit is in milliseconds.
%
% time_l: The average response time of a component measured on the Linux platform. 
% The Linux platform runs Linux Fedora Core 4. It equips a 2.66GHz Intel Pentium 4 
% CPU, 1GB of memory, and 7200RPM of hard drive. The unit is in milliseconds.
%
% memory: The average memory usage of a component. The unit is in bytes. Measurement 
% of memory only considers statically allocated memory (i.e., array) and dynamically 
% allocated memory (i.e., memory allocated through routine ¡°malloc¡±, ¡°alloc¡±, etc.). 
% The stack, heap, and other memory allocated by system for execution are not counted 
% since their sizes depend on compiler and platform. 
%
% quality: The average output accuracy or precison of a component. The unit is component 
% dependent.
